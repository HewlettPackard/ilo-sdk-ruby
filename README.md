# Ruby SDK for HPE iLO
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ilo-sdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/ilo-sdk)

Software Development Kit for interacting with the Hewlett Packard Enterprise iLO (Integrated Lights-Out) server management technology.

## Installation

- Require the gem in your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem 'ilo-sdk'
  ```

  Then run `$ bundle install`
- Or run the command:

  ```bash
  $ gem install ilo-sdk
  ```


## Client
Everything you do with this API happens through a client object.  
Creating the client object is the first step; then you can perform actions on the client.  

```ruby
require 'ilo-sdk'
client = ILO_SDK::Client.new(
  host: 'https://ilo.example.com',
  user: 'Administrator',              # This is the default
  password: 'secret123',
  ssl_enabled: true,                  # This is the default and strongly encouraged
  logger: Logger.new(STDOUT),         # This is the default
  log_level: :info                   # This is the default
)
```

:lock: Tip: Check the file permissions because the password is stored in clear-text.

### Custom logging
The default logger is a standard logger to STDOUT, but if you want to specify your own, you can.  However, your logger must implement the following methods:

```ruby
debug(String)
info(String)
warn(String)
error(String)
level=(Symbol, etc.) # The parameter here will be the log_level attribute
```


## Actions
Actions are performed on the client, and defined in the [helper modules](lib/ilo-sdk/helpers).

```

#### Firmware
```ruby
# Get the firmware version:

```

#### HTTPS Certificate
```ruby
# Get the current SSL Certificate and check to see if expires within 24 hours
expiration = client.get_certificate.not_after.to_datetime
tomorrow = DateTime.now + 1

if expiration < tomorrow
  # Generate a Certificate Signing Request:
  # Params: country_code, state, city, organization, organizational_unit, common_name
  client.generate_csr('US', 'Texas', 'Houston', 'myCompany', 'myUnit', 'example.com')

  # Wait for the CSR to be generated (will take about 10 minutes):
  csr = nil
  while(csr.nil?) do
    sleep(60) # 60 seconds
    csr = client.get_csr
  end

  # Here you'll need to have a step that submits the csr to a certificate authority
  # (or self-signs it) and gets back the signed certificate. It will look something like:
  # -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  # lines_of_secret_text
  # -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  # For this example, we're assuming we've read in the content of the certificate to the
  # "cert" variable (as a string).

  client.import_certificate(cert)
end
```

#### Log Entry

client.insert_virtual_media(id, image)

# Eject virtual media at a certain id:
client.eject_virtual_media(id)
```

## Custom requests
In most cases, interacting with the client object is enough, but sometimes you need to make your own custom requests to the iLO.
This project makes it extremely easy to do with some built-in methods for the client object. Here are some examples:

```ruby
# Get a list of schemas:
response = client.rest_api(:get, '/rest/v1/Schemas')
# or even more simple:
response = client.rest_get('/rest/v1/Schemas')

# Then we can validate the response and convert the response body into a hash...
data = client.response_handler(response)
```

This example is about as basic as it gets, but you can make any type of iLO request.
If a resource does not do what you need, this will allow you to do it.
Please refer to the documentation and [code](lib/ilo-sdk/rest.rb) for complete list of methods and information about how to use them.
